                Hi, I’m Joshua DeConto, and I have decided to join a college course that I feel would <br>
                be the most beneficial for me both in present and future. For the course that I am currently <br>
                taking is the computer programming and information technology program, this decision was <br>
                made for a couple different reasons, those being, it is amazing to take for future job <br>
                opportunities and careers, computers are what I grew up with (ex. I started using and <br>
                learning on the computer at the age of 5 and have continued that practice to this day), <br>
                and it is what I personally know best out of all of the courses that were available to me.<br>
                 The position of IT and my main interest in these classes comes from a personal place for <br>
                 me, it all stems from my father. My father is an IT worker at Algoma University, and what <br>
                 sparked my interest was when he would tell me about his day and explain, roughly, <br>
                 how he solved the issues and problems that arrived, and it always fascinated me, so I've <br>
                 decided to go into that field. The other reason I chose this particular area of schooling <br>
                 is due to my love for learning new concepts and exploring new programs and how to use them <br>
                 effectively. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is a little bit about my personal self. I am very much a gamer at heart, I started <br>
                playing video games at the age of 5 starting with God Of War 2 on the Playstation 2. I <br>
                play all sorts of different games ranging from, action, story telling, indie, stooting, <br>
                etc. my personal favorate genre is the retro shoter games such as the old Doom <br>
                franchise, Blood, Quake, etc. and the retro inspired shooters like Dusk, Amid Evil, <br>
                Ultrakill, etc. I also like to draw and make my own stories, which I have stopped as up <br>
                late, however this is just due to the wall that I have run myself into in terms of writing.<br>
                I enjoy listening to music, especially when I play the affirm mentioned retro and retro <br>
                inspired shooter games. The  music I most commonly listen to is metal music, however I do <br>
                enjoy calmming japanese style music as well.<br><br>
