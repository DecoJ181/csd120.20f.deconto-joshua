                Welcome to Joshua DeConto's CSD120 Website!
            </h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Joshua DeConto, and I have decided to join a college course that I feel would
                be the most beneficial for me both in present and future. For the course that I am currently 
                taking is the computer programming and information technology program, this decision was 
                made for a couple different reasons, those being, it is amazing to take for future job 
                opportunities and careers, computers are what I grew up with (ex. I started using and 
                learning on the computer at the age of 5 and have continued that practice to this day), 
                and it is what I personally know best out of all of the courses that were available to me.
                 The position of IT and my main interest in these classes comes from a personal place for 
                 me, it all stems from my father. My father is an IT worker at Algoma University, and what 
                 sparked my interest was when he would tell me about his day and explain, roughly, 
                 how he solved the issues and problems that arrived, and it always fascinated me, so I've 
                 decided to go into that field. The other reason I chose this particular area of schooling 
                 is due to my love for learning new concepts and exploring new programs and how to use them 
                 effectively. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is a little bit about my personal self. I am very much a gamer at heart, I started 
                playing video games at the age of 5 starting with God Of War 2 on the Playstation 2. I 
                play all sorts of different games ranging from, action, story telling, indie, stooting, 
                etc. my personal favorate genre is the retro shoter games such as the old Doom 
                franchise, Blood, Quake, etc. and the retro inspired shooters like Dusk, Amid Evil, 
                Ultrakill, etc. I also like to draw and make my own stories, which I have stopped as up 
                late, however this is just due to the wall that I have run myself into in terms of writing.
                I enjoy listening to music, especially when I play the affirm mentioned retro and retro 
                inspired shooter games. The  music I most commonly listen to is metal music, however I do 
                enjoy calmming japanese style music as well.
                If you have any questions or would like to know more about me contact me at the bottom of the page.
